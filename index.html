                While many standard shadow techniques exist for modern pipelines, they fail to address a core issue: 
                rendering full real-time shadows and wasting resources on static geometry for just a few dynamic shadow casters. In our 
                top-down scene or a complex environment, that tends to be very costly. <br>

              <p>
                We concluded for scenarios with complex lighting but only a few dynamic shadow casters — like our top-down environment — per-object shadow rendering is the natural solution.
              </p>

              <div class="cs-detail-label">Exploration: Prototyping the Pipeline</div>
              <p>
                Starting with Unity's Decal Projector as a prototype, I tried capturing character
                silhouettes and projecting them as shadows. Then I replaced silhouettes with actual depth
                maps. This unlocked light attenuation and PCSS, giving the shadows proper falloff and soft edges.
                <br>
                However, this approach worked for directional lights. It hit a fundamental limitation: Decal Projectors are orthographic by design
                and cannot correctly project point light shadows, beyond that, they weren't built for shadows — they
                introduced pipeline overhead and interfered with actual decal rendering needs.
                <br>
                The production system needed to be purpose-built.
              </p>

              <div class="cs-detail-label">Solution: Per-Object Shadow Feature</div>
              <!-- [Fig 1.1: System Diagram - Flow chart: Actor + Light Registration → Shadow RT Capture → Projection Matrix → Screen-Space Composite] -->
              <div class="cs-placeholder-img">[Fig 1.1: Pipeline Flow - Registration → Capture → Projection → Composite]</div>

              <p>The resulted system is a custom URP Render Feature built on Render Graph. It
                consists of four core components:</p>

              <p><strong>Registration System</strong><br>
                Actor-light pairs are registered dynamically via trigger volumes. When a character enters a light's
                influence range, the system adds them to the shadow rendering queue. This keeps the overhead
                proportional to active pairs, not total scene complexity.</p>

              <p><strong>Shadow Rendering</strong><br>
                Each registered pair gets a virtual camera positioned at the light source, with a projection matrix
                computed based on the character's bounding box. The camera captures a high-resolution depth map just for
                that character, at a resolution the character defines. No scene geometry involved.</p>

              <p><strong>Projection & Occlusion</strong><br>
                The depth map is projected using the light's perspective matrix — true perspective projection for point
                lights. With screen depth to world space reconstruction, the system factors in light attributes,
                attenuation and edge-soften. Occlusion is handled via batched physics raycasts (not raymarching) — a
                pragmatic trade-off between accuracy and performance to check light-to-character visibility and clips
                shadows at wall boundaries.</p>

              <p><strong>Screen-Space Compositing</strong><br>
                Shadows are composited into screen space using a pre-multiplied blend with conditional masking. The
                system identifies lit areas and ignores areas already in shadow. Artists control intensity, edge
                softness, color tint, PCSS samples, and blend factors. Because it's a post-process overlay rather than
                baked into the lighting pipeline, artists have full control over the shadow's visual appearance without
                touching shader code.</p>

              <!-- [Fig 1.2: System Controls] -->
              <div class="cs-placeholder-img">[Fig 1.2: System Controls - Tuning global editor settings]</div>

              <div class="cs-detail-label">Results</div>
              <p>
                The system renders high-quality, artist-controlled PCSS shadows at ~3ms per frame — cost scales only
                with the real shadow count and quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach enables us to fully bake global lighting and render shadows separately. In our test scene
                of top-down interior, 20+ point lights, and complex geometry, frame rate went from 27 FPS to 80+ FPS —
                same shadow fidelity at a fraction of cost.
              </p>

              <div class="cs-placeholder-img">[Fig 1.3: Before/After Comparison - Global shadow maps vs. per-object
                shadows]</div>

              <p>
                The system is modular by design — shadow appearance, registration logic, culling strategies are all
                independently configurable. It's a general-purpose solution for any scenario with complex lighting but
                limited dynamic shadow casters: top-down games, narrative-driven interiors, architectural visualization.

              <div class="cs-detail-label">Challenge: Designing a consistent visual for realistic shading</div>
              <p>
                The environment for Eden was built on a high-fidelity baseline where every element responds naturally to light and space. I used the Bakery light mapper and APV scenarios to establish the scene lighting, combined with SSR, HBAO, SSGI, and volumetric lighting to create a world that felt physically consistent and reactive.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, bringing characters into this environment revealed a new challenge. I initially tried liltoon, a widely-adopted stylized shader, but it hit a wall as I started tuning the scene lighting, exposing several critical bottlenecks:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Incomplete Integration:</strong> The shader could not sample scene reflections or APV data and failed to support multiple lights, leaving characters as flat overlays.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Overhead:</strong> The bulky and feature-rich structure would lead to unnecessary variant bloat and compilation stalls.</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural Mismatch:</strong> Its legacy pass-based architecture was not built for a modern unified pipeline and could become a technical debt to modify.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It became clear that achieving a seamless blend of stylization and realism required more than an off-the-shelf wrapper. To gain full artistic control and ensure visual integrity, we moved toward a custom shading solution that is native to the pipeline.
              </p>

              <div class="cs-detail-label">Architecture: Bridging Stylization and Deferred Rendering</div>
              <p>
                I started by prototyping a custom Forward shader, but quickly it made obvious that deferred screen-space effects wouldn't work without proper G-buffer. Therefore, we need to decide a pipeline solution, I evaluated three following industrial standard architecture for Cel-shading:

              <p>
                Building a custom G-Buffer from scratch would be a maintenance trap in a constantly updating render environment like Unity 6. Recognizing this, we made the pragmatic decision to choose a modular, interchangeable, and actively maintained shader as the base—Real Toon. Building on its framework, we effectively outsourced the low-level plumbing, allowing focus on the specific NPR features that define the project’s visual character.

                To achieve the desired visual quality, I drew inspiration from both 3D rendering techniques and 2D illustrations; went through several iterations before arriving at our current visual style. Each component is fine-tuned to strike a best balance between technical constraints and artistic intent.
